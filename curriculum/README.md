# Portfolio

This project, called **Portfolio**, is my personal website to introduce myself, showcase my skills, and share all my projects—both completed and in progress. The site is designed to provide a clear and elegant overview of my professional journey and expertise.

## Features

- **Personal Introduction:** An introductory section with my photo, name, role, and a brief description.
- **Skills:** A grid of cards displaying the technologies and skills I possess.
- **Projects:** A section listing my projects with interactive cards that link to their respective GitHub repositories or detailed pages.
- **Interactive Experience:** Background animations, such as the animated star field, to enhance the visual experience.
- **Responsive Navigation:** A fixed header with a navigation menu and a footer containing contact information.

## Technologies Used

- **React** for building the user interface and managing components.
- **React Bootstrap** for a responsive layout and pre-built UI components.
- **i18next** for handling localization and translations.
- **FontAwesome** for social icons and other graphical elements.

## Design Inspiration

The design of this portfolio was inspired by a TikTok video where the homepage of a similar website was showcased. I really liked the background style, the color palette, and the overall design of the landing page, and I used these elements as inspiration—essentially "borrowing" the background style, colors, and layout. If I ever find that TikTok video again, I will link it to properly credit the source of inspiration.
